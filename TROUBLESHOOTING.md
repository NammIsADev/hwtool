## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

Encountering issues while using HWTool? Hereâ€™s a detailed guide to help you resolve common problems:

---

### **1. Device Not Detected in Download Mode**
- **Symptoms:** Device doesnâ€™t appear as **USB SER** or **Serial Port HUAWEI USB COM 1.0** in Device Manager.
- **Solutions:**
  - Check that youâ€™re using a high-quality USB cableâ€”poor-quality cables can cause connection issues.
  - Verify that the testpoint is correctly shorted. If unsure, revisit guides specific to your device model.
  - Ensure that conductive tweezers or tools are used for shorting the testpoint. Non-conductive materials wonâ€™t work.
  - Try a different USB port or computer to rule out hardware compatibility issues.
  - Reboot the device and repeat the steps, ensuring all drivers (HiSuite, Huawei Testpoint Drivers) are installed.

### **2. Device Manager Displays as "Unknown Device"**
- **Symptoms:** Your device is detected as **Unknown Device** instead of USB SER or Serial Port.
- **Solutions:**
  - Install Huawei Testpoint Drivers if they arenâ€™t installed already.
  - Verify that HiSuite is correctly installedâ€”sometimes, HiSuite can automatically resolve driver conflicts.
  - Uninstall the "Unknown Device" driver via Device Manager, then reconnect your device to reinstall drivers.
  - Check for device-specific drivers online and install them manually.

### **3. Bootloader Unlock Fails**
- **Symptoms:** The unlock process fails, or an error appears during the procedure.
- **Solutions:**
  - Ensure youâ€™ve correctly followed disassembly steps, especially accessing the testpoint.
  - Verify your device is supported by HWTool. If not sure, check the [Supported Devices List](https://github.com/NammIsADev/hwtool/blob/main/SUPPORT-DEVICES.md).
  - Double-check that PotatoNV is installed and configured properly.
  - Retry the process using the latest PotatoNV version available on GitHub.
  - Check your EMUI versionâ€”HWTool works best on EMUI 8 and EMUI 9. EMUI 10 or later may not be compatible.

### **4. Fastboot/ADB Commands Fail**
- **Symptoms:** Fastboot or ADB commands donâ€™t execute or fail midway.
- **Solutions:**
  - Ensure ADB is installed and added to your system PATH variable.
  - Restart your computer and device, then reattempt the procedure.
  - Use the command `adb devices` to check if your device is detected. If not, verify your USB connection and driver installation.
  - For Fastboot errors, use the command `fastboot devices` to confirm detection.
  - If errors persist, reinstall ADB/Fastboot tools from official Android SDK resources.

### **5. TWRP or ROM Flashing Fails**
- **Symptoms:** TWRP recovery or custom ROM installation doesnâ€™t succeed.
- **Solutions:**
  - Verify youâ€™re using the correct ROM or recovery files for your device model.
  - Double-check your partition selection in Fastbootâ€”incorrect partitions can lead to flashing errors.
  - Ensure the ROM file is fully downloaded and not corrupted. If necessary, re-download the file.
  - Reboot into Fastboot mode and try flashing again.
  - If youâ€™re using TWRP, ensure itâ€™s compatible with your device and EMUI version.

### **6. Testpoint is Difficult to Access**
- **Symptoms:** Youâ€™re unable to locate or safely short the testpoint on your deviceâ€™s motherboard.
- **Solutions:**
  - Refer to detailed video guides for your device modelâ€”these often include step-by-step visuals.
  - Use a magnifying glass or similar tool to pinpoint the exact testpoint location.
  - Be cautious when handling planar cables or other fragile components during disassembly.
  - If disassembly proves too challenging, consider using paid software that supports "software testpoint."
