## üîß What is HWTool?

HWTool simplifies the process of unlocking bootloaders, flashing recoveries, installing custom ROMs, and managing device recovery for Huawei smartphones and tablets with Kirin chipsets. It automates many steps, making it easier for users to customize their devices safely and effectively.

---

## ‚ùì How HWTool Works

HWTool automates the unlocking process using **ADB** and **Fastboot** tools. Here's how it works:

1. **Setup:**
   - Guides you on installing additional drivers such as **Huawei Testpoint Drivers**.

2. **Disassembly Guidance:**
   - Provides detailed instructions for safely disassembling your device to access the testpoint, with recommended tools like a plastic card and tweezers.

3. **Flash Process:**
   - Uses Fastboot and ADB to flash custom ROMs and recovery tools like **TWRP**.

4. **Bootloader Unlocking:**
   - Automatically flashes the bootloader into RAM and includes optional steps such as disabling FBLOCK security checks for advanced unlocking.

5. **Recovery and ROM Installation:**
   - Guides you through flashing TWRP recovery and installing your selected ROM while ensuring compatibility.

For more details, refer to the [PotatoNV GitHub repository](https://github.com/mashed-potatoes/PotatoNV?tab=readme-ov-file#how-it-works).

## üìã Features

- Unlock bootloaders for supported Huawei Kirin devices.
- Flash custom recovery tools like **TWRP**.
- Install custom ROMs on compatible devices.
- Step-by-step guidance for disassembly and flashing processes.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üìÇ Requirements:

1. **ADB** tools installed and configured on your computer.  
2. Download and install **PotatoNV** (not included in HWTool - extract to "bin" folder).  
   - Refer to the [PotatoNV GitHub repository](https://github.com/mashed-potatoes/PotatoNV).  
3. Obtain compatible files:
   - Android versions **8** or **9**.
   - **TWRP** recovery.  
   - A custom **ROM** suitable for your device.  
4. Backup all important data to avoid any loss during the process.

### üõ† Steps:

1. Verify your device is listed in the [Supported Devices List](https://github.com/NammIsADev/hwtool/blob/main/SUPPORT-DEVICES.md).
2. Install PotatoNV and follow HWTool instructions to unlock your bootloader.  
   ‚ö† This process can potentially brick your device if not followed carefully.

## üõ† Step-by-Step Guide

### üî© Step 1: Disassembling Your Device

1. **Access the Motherboard:** Disassemble your device to access the testpoint contacts.  
2. **Experience Check:**  
   - If unsure about your ability to disassemble the device safely, consider using paid software that supports "software testpoint."
   - Example image:

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59458023-0b57-4f70-812d-321ae0475d2c)

  **The marks may vary:**
  + Only one point is marked in the photo.
  + In the photo, a line is drawn between the point and the metal shield.
  + In the photo, a line is drawn between two points.

3. **Watch Video Guides:** Refer to online video manuals to understand the disassembly process.  
4. **Handle Components Carefully:** Be cautious with cables and fragile parts.

### üöÄ Step 2: Entering Download Mode

1. **Locate the Testpoint:** Search for the testpoint location specific to your device model.  
   Example: For Honor 9 Lite (LLD-L31), search for "LLD testpoint."
2. **Short-Circuit Testpoint:** Typically involves short-circuiting specific points on the motherboard while connecting the USB cable.  
3. **Verify Detection:**  
   - Open "Device Manager" on your computer.  
   - Look for **USB SER** or **Serial Port HUAWEI USB COM 1.0**.  

### üîì Step 3: Unlocking the Bootloader

1. **Install Necessary Software:**  
   - **HiSuite** for Huawei device management.  
   - **Huawei Testpoint Drivers** for device detection.  
2. **Flash the Bootloader to RAM:** Flashing into RAM ensures safety as it doesn‚Äôt write to permanent storage.  
3. **Optional - Disable FBLOCK:** Allows advanced unlocking but poses risks on certain devices.  
4. **Complete the Process:** Follow on-screen instructions in HWTool to unlock your bootloader.
