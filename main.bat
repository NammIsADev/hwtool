echo    If you are wondering why you need to do something with the unfortunate testpoint,
echo    then read the contents of the spoiler below.
echo    To search, use the model name before the hyphen + "testpoint".
echo    For example for Honor 9 Lite (LLD-L31) you should Google "lld testpoint".

echo    Open the "Device Manager" â€“ you should see an unknown device named USB SER,
echo    or Serial Port HUAWEI USB COM 1.0.

echo    Warning: FBLOCK unlocking works correctly only on devices with Kirin 960 or 65x. Disabling this option can cause serious problems on legacy devices.
